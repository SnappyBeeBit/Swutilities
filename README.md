## Trench Run

input.csv is the input file
takes in a list of card cost counts starting with 0
(0 0s, 0 1s, 13 2s, etc)

If you want to modify the code yourself make sure you have odin installed, yeah its not your typicaly programming language, get over it

Executable should still work on any windows system though

./trench_run.exe <question> <debug_log>


# TODO 
more control of input via executable
